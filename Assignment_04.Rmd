# Responses and justification

#A) Z-score was used to normalize data due to the variation in value
# multiple orders of magnitude. After running both WSS and silhouette,
# 5 clusters were determined to be the optimal quantity. K-means itself was
# used because of the relative regularity of the data, falling into distinct
# clusters.

#B) The five-cluster solution reveals clear segmentation among the 21 
# pharmaceutical firms. Each polygon in the two-dimensional projection 
# represents a financially distinct group. Cluster 4 (blue) contains 
# closely related, low-risk firms with similar balance-sheet strength, 
# while Cluster 2 (olive) stands out for its high-growth or high-profit 
# profile. Cluster 3 (teal) is composed of a few small, specialized companies 
# with distinctive financial ratios, and Cluster 1 (red) represents
# mid-performing firms with average profitability and size. Cluster 5 (purple) 
# displays greater internal variability, suggesting firms with mixed strategies
# or transitional performance levels.
```
```{r}
#C) Patterns were evident when comparing the clusters against qualitative firm
# characteristics. The most profitable and high-growth clusters
# (e.g., Cluster 2) tended to include firms with Buy or Strong Buy
# recommendations and were primarily listed on the NYSE, while smaller or
# lower-performing clusters had more diverse recommendations and exchange
# listings. This suggests that the financial performance-based clustering is
# consistent with analyst sentiment and firm size as reflected in exchange and
# location.
```

```{r}
#D) Cluster 1: Average Performers
#   Cluster 2: Fast-Growing Companies
#   Cluster 3: Large, Stable Firms
#   Cluster 4: Highly-Borrowing Firms
#   Cluster 5: Smaller or Unpredictable Firms
